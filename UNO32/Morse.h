 * @note This function assumes that the buttons are all unpressed at startup, so that the first
 *       event it will see is a BUTTON_EVENT_*DOWN.
 *
 * So pressing the button for 0.1s, releasing it for 0.1s, pressing it for 0.3s, and then waiting
 * will decode the string '.-' (A). It will trigger the following order of events:
 * 9 MORSE_EVENT_NONEs, 1 MORSE_EVENT_DOT, 39 MORSE_EVENT_NONEs, a MORSE_EVENT_DASH, 69
 * MORSE_EVENT_NONEs, a MORSE_EVENT_END_CHAR, and then MORSE_EVENT_INTER_WORDs.
