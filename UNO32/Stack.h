/**
 * Here we declare the stack struct. While a stack works as a FILO (first-in,
 * last-out) we will be implementing this on top of a C array. The way this
 * will work is that the bottom of the stack will be array element 0. The top
 * of the stack will be the last element in the array. The index of that last
 * element (the top of the stack) will be stored in currentItemIndex.
 *
 * So:
 *  - stackItems: Contains all the floats that are in the queue in ascending
 *                order.
 *  - currentItemIndex: Contains the index in stackItems of the top of the
 *                      stack.
 *  - intialized: Stores whether or not the array was initialized. FALSE if
 *                it isn't and TRUE if it is.
